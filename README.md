### swb01's minlex - single program - MinLexDriver.exe

This is swb01's minlex program - in a single program: [MinLexDriver.exe](https://github.com/1to9only/swb01-s-minlex--single-program--MinLexDriver.exe/releases).

The program is built from source code (release 4) provided by swb01, with some modifications by me.
- merged MinLex9X9SR1.vb into MinLexDriver.vb, and modified to compile
- fixed (removed) the null character written at end of output file

I only use option 2 - i.e. other options are not used (untested).

Note: The input file size must be a multiple of 83, i.e. each line = 81-chars sudoku + CRLF.
